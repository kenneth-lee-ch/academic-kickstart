Kenneth is a recent graduate from Brigham Young University-Hawaii. Currently, he is pursuing a M.S. in Statistics at UC Davis. His research interests lie in machine learning with an emphasis on deep learning.

One of his future goals is to establish an AI-driven automated restaurant that can deliver fresh food at a low price. In his spare time, he likes reading books, cooking, hiking, and traveling. Above all, he loves learning new things. His recent favorite book is Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference by Judea Pearl.
