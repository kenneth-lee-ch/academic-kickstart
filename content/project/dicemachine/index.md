title: Meet Don, the Autonomous Dice Rolling Machine
summary: We estimated probabilities for tetrahedral and triangular dice using the sphere projection method and multivariate calculus. To test our results, we printed several dice of varying sizes. After a few thousand initial rolls, we realized that our calculations weren’t accurately describing the situation and that bias could have been introduced due to rolling the dice by hand. Therefore, we built a machine to roll the dice.
