abstract: Homegrown exit surveys tend to expand over time to include everything but the kitchen sink. This session outlines how a small Institutional Research (IR) office utilized a student research team to condense and improve the Graduating Student Survey (GSS) at BYU-Hawaii.  Their charge was to refocus on the universityâ€™s mission (and contribution to the public good) and make the survey results more meaningful and accessible to campus stakeholders. Results from factor analysis, a review of literature and existing similar surveys, and information gleaned from faculty and staff members informed the survey revision pilot.   Results of the pilot, feedback from data consumers, the new version of the survey, and next steps will be shared.  Session participants will be able to discuss the methodology used in this case with presenters, and understand how student researchers can help expand the capacity of a small IR office.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
